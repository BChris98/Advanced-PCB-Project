1 : Route the OUTPUT CAPACITOR to the IC with short and wide trace to minimize the parasitic inductance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason is that the current flowing through the output capacitors is pulse-type.
Considering the V = L × dI / dt, the parasitic inductance between the IC and the output capacitors
would cause voltage spike and ringing at the SW pin. Too high voltage spike can damage the IC and
the ringing causes EMI problems.

If it's not possible or hard to place the large package capacitors close to the IC, 
a small package capacitor can be placed near the IC and the bulk capacitors are placed somewhere farther. 




2 : The INDUCTOR should be placed close to the IC.
----------------------------------------------------

Reason : to reduce the radiated EMI
The copper of the SW-node should be optimized to handle the large current
with minimum area. The SW-node is the noisy source of the boost converter, so any trace of a
sensitive node, such as FB, should be far away from the SW 



3 : The ground-node of the INPUT CAPACITOR should be close to the IC power ground pin.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The input capacitor ground-node, output capacitor ground-node and the IC ground-pin form a 
PowerGround of the boost converter.

The VIN voltage is usually stable voltage, so a large VIN-node copper area would not cause trouble
and a large copper area can help to improve the thermal performance. We can use the inductor pin that is
connected to Vin but closer to the output capacitor ground pin. 

N.B : The distance between VIN-node of the input capacitor and inductor is
not important because the current through the input capacitor is continuous.



4 : the remaining small signal components have to be close to the IC
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The analog components and nodes are sensitive to noise, especially when they have large input
impedance, such as FB pin. Make sure these components are close to the IC. 
The traces between the components and IC should be short to minimize the parasitic capacitance with noisy SW node.

NEVER route the FB TRACE IN PARALLEL WITH THE SW NODE CLOSELY; otherwise the switching noise would couple to
the FB pin and cause problems.


5: The GROUND-NODE of the analog SMALL SIGNAL components and AGND pin of the IC form a SignalGround,
which must be connected to the Power-Ground of the IC through a single point. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The single point should be closed to the PGND pin)

Make sure no large power current is flowing through the
Signal-Ground. Otherwise, noise coupling into the control circuit could causes bad output voltage
regulation, inaccurate current limit, or other abnormal behaviors
